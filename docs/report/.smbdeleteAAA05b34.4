\subsubsection{Test data}\label{sec:test_data}
\cite{mikolov3} propose evaluating the regularities of the learned embedding space with a test set of analogy questions. The questions are of the form "{\it a} is to {\it b} as {\it c} is to \_\_ ". The test set contains 14 different types of analogies (see Table \ref{table:analogical}) relating to semantic concepts and grammatical relations.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Measuring linguistic regularity via analogies}
We evaluate the performance of (a) pre-trained Google vectors, (b) our Skip-Gram model, (c) our CBOW model, on the analogical reasoning test set introduced in section \ref{sec:test_data}. Given three query words (e.g. {\it Paris, France, London}), the task is to return the answer that fits with the analogy (in this case, {\it England}). This problem can be solved in many ways, \cite{mikolov1} propose a simple solution that relies on the inherent regularities of the embedding space learned by the Skip-Gram and CBOW models. The method uses simple vector algebra in the embedding space to find the solution word given three query words. For example, suppose the analogical relation of interest is {\it A} is to {\it B} as {\it} C is to {\it D}. Given three query words, {\it A, B, C}, the predicted solution is computed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the vector representations of each word, $\phi(A), \phi(B), \phi(C)$.
\item Let $v = \phi(B) - \phi(A) + \phi(C)$.
\item Do a nearest neighbors search, based on cosine distance, to find the $K$ closest word vectors to $v$. In other words, solve for the top $K$ solutions to 
	\begin{align} \max_u\frac{ v \cdot u}{\| u \| \| v \|}\ \end{align}
\end{enumerate}

The intuition behind this method is that the cosine distance between $\phi(A - B)$ and $\phi(C - D)$ is small when {\it A} and {\it B} are analogous to {\it C} and {\it D}. Figure \ref{fig:offsets} illustrates this intuition.
