\section{Project Goals and Timeline}\label{sec:timeline}

We have several interrelated goals for this project which we now describe. 
The details of how we will evaluate each goal are described in \ref{sec:evaluation}.
We divide the time from now until the presentation into three blocks of two weeks each.
 \begin{enumerate}
\item The first step is to determine whether or not the linear subspace structure does in fact exist. 
We test this hypothesis as follows. 
 After computing a vector representation for words on a corpus, we will use a subspace clustering algorithm to assign points to clusters. 
For each cluster we determine the rank $K$ subspace that best fits the points assigned to the cluster and compute the reconstruction error given by the low rank approximation. 
We do this for increasing $K$ and plot the reconstruction error as $K$ increases. 
If the points assigned to a cluster do lie close to a low dimensional subspace, then we expect the reconstruction error to initially be high but decrease and eventually level off close to zero for some $K$ smaller than the original dimension. 
We intend to conduct this experiment during the first two weeks.
 
\item Our next step will be to check if the subspaces (clusters) can be associated with semantically or syntactically meaningful concepts.
We allot the following two weeks for this task. 

\item Finally, if we discover subspaces that are syntactically or semantically meaningful, we will then attempt to exploit this structure for some practical purposes. 
We hypothesize that if we were to project the points down onto such spaces, it will be easier to make inferences about similar/dissimilar words that make sense within their context. We have two ideas we would like to explore in this context. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We believe the subspaces will be helpful in word-sense disambiguation. Suppose we have several parameterized subspaces, each associated with a different superclass or context. 
If we take the word vector for `apple' we would expect that if it was projected onto the `fruit' subspace then its nearest neighbors would be `pear',`orange', etc. and if we project it down onto the electronics subspace its nearest neighbors would be `mac',`android', etc. 
For words that have an ambiguous meaning,  we hypothesize that it will be easier to find similar words conditioned on a given context. 
		\item We also think the analogical reasoning questions detailed in Section \ref{sec:evaluation} might be more accurately answered after projecting words that can be well approximated by a subspace onto the subspace. 
	\end{enumerate} 
	
This goal will be the focus of the last two weeks before the final presentation where we will also generate relevant plots and figures to showcase our experiments and analyses.
\end{enumerate}
